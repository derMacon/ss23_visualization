## Final Project

### General
- presentation of the results serves as an oral exam
- available graphs at [./graphs/](./graphs/)
- regenerate code by running (`./src/vis_main.py`)[python3 ./src/vis_main.py]
- dataset source [data world](https://data.world/dataquest/mlb-game-logs)
  - user: `spam-sh`
  - pass: `abc1234abc1234`
- since the dataset is too large for a GitHub project, download it locally to the following directory
  - `./datasets/retrosheets/game-logs_combined/game_logs_data-world.csv`
